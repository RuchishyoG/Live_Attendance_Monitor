# Live_Attendance_Monitor
A bidirectional entry &amp; exit monitor which displays the number of people in a room so that attendance can be limited to ensure social distancing in the COVID-19 Pandemic.

This is an Arduino based embedded system, where it is aimed to count the number of people present in a certain room at any instance.

In this COVID era, social distancing is a very important protocol to be followed amongst others. To ensure such physical distancing, it is necessary to set a strict limit to the number of people present in a closed room. This project aims to serve this purpose. 

Even though the project has been curated for the COVID situation, it still has its utilities in the post-COVID era. This project shall eventually help in preventing excessive gathering at any closed place at any time. 

Banks, post offices, shopping malls are some of the very examples of places where we can effectively apply this project.
